# Columbus-Project

With students becoming closer and closer to graduating College, they are starting to apply to companies in order to get their starting job. Although they just start applying everywhere and anywhere without looking at the company and seeing if it's a valuable company or not. 


With Project Columbus, this project was created to bring a community of undergradutes and graduates to comment and rate companies to show how professional, and how well they treat their employees. Users can comment, rate companies, and rate users in order to help users get a better idea of a company before they apply to a company.
